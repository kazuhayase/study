    "Thought:The provided text explains that additional premiums are part of the insurance premium that is added by insurance companies to cover the necessary expenses for managing an insurance contract. The method for setting these additional premiums has been changed from a pre-approval system to a post-monitoring system due to revisions in the Insurance Business Law Enforcement Regulations. Insurance companies are now responsible for setting these fees on their own, ensuring sufficiency and fairness of revenue and expenses. They are also obligated to regularly measure and report their financial status related to business expenses to the competent authority. The adequacy and fairness of the additional premiums are verified post-factum, taking into account the cost of acquiring new contracts (initial costs) and the cost of maintaining and managing contracts (running costs), differentiated by sales channels and types of insurance.\n",

    "Observation: 変額年金とは、加入者が支払う保険料を株式や債券などの投資商品に運用し、その運用成果によって年金額が変動する年金保険の一種です。加入者は自分のリスク許容度や運用方針に応じて、運用資産を選択することができます。投資の成果が良ければ年金額が増加しますが、悪ければ減少するリスクを持ちます。\n",
    "\n",
    "日本においては、金融商品取引法に基づく適切な説明と情報提供が求められており、変額年金契約を結ぶ際には投資リスクや手数料などについて充分な理解が必要です。また、運用状況に応じて定期的な見直しや資産配分の変更を行うことも可能です。\n",
    "\n",
    "変額年金は運用成果が保証されていないため、予定利率を設定する従来型の定額年金保険とは異なります。そのため、将来受け取る年金額が予測しにくいという特徴がありますが、一方でインフレリスクに対する保護や資産増加のチャンスもあります。\n",

    "Thought:The provided excerpt explains variable annuities as a type of pension insurance where the annuity amount fluctuates based on the performance of investments made with the insurance premiums paid by the policyholder. Policyholders can select the assets they wish to invest in according to their risk tolerance and investment strategy. While there is a chance for the annuity amount to increase with good investment performance, there is also a risk of decrease. In Japan, proper explanation and information provision based on the Financial Instruments and Exchange Act are required when entering into a variable annuity contract, and it is necessary to fully understand investment risks and fees. Regular reviews and asset allocation changes are also possible based on the performance of the investments. Unlike fixed annuities with set interest rates, variable annuities do not guarantee investment outcomes, making the future annuity amount unpredictable. However, they offer protection against inflation risks and opportunities for asset growth. It is crucial for users to consider whether variable annuities are suitable for them, taking into account their post-retirement life plan, asset status, and market trends.\n",
